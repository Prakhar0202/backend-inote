# iNote Backend

The iNote backend is a robust and efficient server-side application designed to support the iNote React application, which allows users to take and manage notes seamlessly. This backend is built using modern technologies including MongoDB, Mongoose, ExpressJS, and Thunderclient, ensuring scalability, performance, and ease of use.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- **Login and Signup Pages**: The backend supports comprehensive user authentication, including secure login and signup functionalities. Users can create new accounts and securely log in using their credentials.
- **Password Hashing**: For enhanced security, user passwords are hashed using industry-standard algorithms before being stored in the database.

### 2. **Database Integration**
- **MongoDB**: The backend leverages MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its flexibility and scalability, to store user data and notes.
- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library to facilitate interactions with MongoDB. It provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model application data, ensuring data integrity and simplifying database operations.

### 3. **RESTful API**
- **ExpressJS**: The backend is built using ExpressJS, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. ExpressJS enables the creation of RESTful APIs, which handle HTTP requests and responses effectively.
- **CRUD Operations**: The backend supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for notes. Users can add new notes, view existing notes, update note content, and delete notes as needed.

### 4. **API Testing and Documentation**
- **Thunderclient**: Thunderclient is integrated for API testing and documentation. It provides an intuitive interface to test API endpoints, ensuring they work as expected and conform to the defined specifications.

## Technical Stack

### **MongoDB**
- A powerful NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- Enables horizontal scaling and high performance for large datasets.

### **Mongoose**
- An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- Simplifies data modeling, schema validation, and query building.
- Provides middleware for pre- and post-hooks, which can be used for data validation and transformation.

### **ExpressJS**
- A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Facilitates the creation of robust APIs and web applications.
- Offers a rich set of HTTP utility methods and middleware.

### **Thunderclient**
- A lightweight REST API client extension for Visual Studio Code.
- Allows developers to test and debug APIs directly from the code editor.
- Supports environment variables, collections, and scripting for advanced testing scenarios.

## Code Structure

### **Models**
- **User Model**: Defines the schema for user data, including username, email, password (hashed), and other relevant fields.
- **Note Model**: Defines the schema for note data, including title, content, timestamps, and user association.

### **Controllers**
- **Auth Controller**: Manages user authentication, including login, signup, and token generation.
- **Note Controller**: Handles CRUD operations for notes, ensuring users can create, read, update, and delete their notes.

### **Routes**
- **Auth Routes**: Defines routes for user authentication (e.g., `/login`, `/signup`).
- **Note Routes**: Defines routes for note operations (e.g., `/notes`, `/notes/:id`).

### **Middleware**
- **Authentication Middleware**: Verifies user tokens and ensures only authenticated users can access certain routes.

## Getting Started

To set up the iNote backend locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iNote-backend.git
   cd iNote-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Test the API**: Use Thunderclient or any other API testing tool to test the available endpoints.

## Conclusion

The iNote backend is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient foundation for the iNote application. With MongoDB, Mongoose, ExpressJS, and Thunderclient, developers can ensure smooth operation and easy maintenance of the backend services, enabling users to enjoy a seamless note-taking experience.
